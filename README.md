## Description

It’s tough to achieve big goals when they seem to overwhelm you. As a consequence, it’s easy to procrastinate on them. One of the best ways to solve this problem is by breaking down a large goal into smaller parts. This is where a to-do list becomes significant. It lets you make large and overwhelming projects manageable.

Also, you get more done by focusing on high-value activities. Once you have a list of things you need to-do, it’s much easier to prioritize the tasks on it. This will ensure you’re always working on the right things.

You can checkout my TODO list Application that helps you get things done much quicker by prioritarizing your goals in a simple application.
